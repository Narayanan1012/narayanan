# My Personal Portfolio

This is the code for my personal portfolio website. It's a simple, sleek design built with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript for dynamic effects.  I wanted to create something clean and minimal to showcase my skills and projects.

## Features

* **Dark Mode:**  The site uses a dark background with white text for a modern look.
* **Fog Effect:** A subtle animated fog effect adds a bit of depth and visual interest.
* **Loader Animation:**  A loading animation keeps things interesting while the page loads.
* **Hover Effects:**  Interactive hover effects on the social media icons and skills add a dynamic touch.
* **Hidden Cat GIF:**  A little Easter egg for those who find it!

## Technical Details

* **HTML:**  Provides the basic structure and content.
* **CSS:** Styles the elements, including layout, typography, colors, and animations.
* **JavaScript:** Used for the loader, dynamic fog generation, and the smooth scrolling effect for anchor links.

## How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git` (replace with your actual repo details)
2. **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

That's it!  No special server setup is required.  The site is designed to be entirely static.
